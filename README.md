# GasTracker
Keeps track of my Gas Consuption

I wanted a way to calculate the average MPG my new vehicle was getting. Instead of creating a spreadsheet and updating that everytime. I just create a small, basic console application that I can pull up and it updates a database for me. Then I can get various stats on my gas consumption habits.
